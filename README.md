This is a code I've used for the Infant Car Alert System. It is the code for the Arduino Uno connected with the Active Buzzer Alarm System, Doppler Sensor, GSM Cellular Shield, and DHT11 Temperature Sensor.The Infant Car Alert System is a reliable way to prevent child deaths due to heat stroke in vehicles due to extreme weather conditions using an inexpensive, programmable device.
